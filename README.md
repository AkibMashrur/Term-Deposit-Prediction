# Term-Deposit-Prediction
PREDICTING TERM DEPOSIT SUBSCRIPTION USING MACHINE LEARNING WITH PYSPARK

The goal of this project is to analyse the market campaign dataset of a Portuguese Bank. Through the analysis the Bank’s management wants to come up with marketing strategies in future which will convince customer to subscribe to their term deposit service.

The assigned dataset is analysed using IPython notebook with Spark Packages including pyspark.ml and spark.sql. In the analysis both unsupervised (K-means and PCA) and supervised (Logistic regression, Decision tree and Naïve Bayes) models are used to evaluate factors that may affect whether a client will subscrib a term deposit or not. The model with the best result will be prescribed to the management to make future decision making.
